## ❗ Folder Structure Rules (Please Read)

- Do not rename, move, or delete any template folder
- Do not remove, rename, or restructure the `packages/` folder
- The `packages/` folder contains core template code
- Each template must remain standalone

Pull requests that change the folder structure may be rejected.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Working Inside `packages/`

All code changes must be made inside the `packages/` folder of the relevant template.

### Allowed
- Bug fixes
- UI / UX improvements
- Tailwind CSS refinements
- Adding or improving components
- Safe refactoring (without breaking structure)

### Not Allowed
- Moving code outside `packages/`
- Sharing code between templates
- Adding root-level shared packages

---

## 🎯 Framework-Specific Contributions

You only need to work on one template at a time.

Example:
```
tailwind-admin-reactjs-free/packages/
```

You do NOT need to update all templates in one pull request.

---

## 🔄 Cross-Framework Changes (Optional)

If a change is generic(layout idea, spacing improvement, component behavior):
- You may apply it to multiple templates — but this is optional.
- If you update only one template, please mention it clearly in the PR description.

---

## 🎨 Tailwind CSS Guidelines
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes
- Avoid inline styles
- Keep spacing, typography, and colors consistent
- Reuse existing patterns where possible

## 📝 Commit Message Guidelines
Use clear and descriptive commit messages:

`
feat(react): add collapsible sidebar
fix(nextjs): fix navbar hydration issue
docs: update contributing guide
`

## 📦 Pull Request Guidelines

Before submitting a PR:
- ✅ Changes are tested locally
- ✅ PR is focused and minimal
- ✅ Folder structure is unchanged
- ✅ Screenshots or videos are added for UI changes (recommended)


PR Title Format

```csharp
[Framework] Short description
